## Background

BadUSB attack exploits built-in firmware Vulnerability affecting USB Flash Drives, allowing threat actors to reprogram the microcontroller in these flash drives to act as HID (Human Interface Device) e.g. Keyboard. Once Connected to its target computer, a bad USB can then execute malicious commands and Payloads. 

Almost every USB Flash Drive is exploitable, Phison Microcontrollers are the most common reprogrammable drives. 

Also, Rubber Ducky is the most common BadUSB tool, Featuring a fast 60 MHz 32-bit CPU, convenient type-A USB connector, Micro SD expandable memory, programmable payload replay button, JTAG interface with GPIO and DFU bootloader.

### Human Interface Devices

The Human Interface Devices (HID) standard enables and simplifies the process of installing such devices as keyboards, mice, and protocols to communicate to the computer.
All HID-defined USB devices deliver self-describing packages that may contain any number of data types and formats.
Nearly every computer device accepts human input from keyboards, hence the ubiquitous HID specification, Keyboards announce themselves to computers as HID devices and are in turn automatically recognized and accepted as a trusted device.

See Microsoft‚Äôs documentation for more information: 

[Introduction to Human Interface Devices (HID) - Windows drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/hid/)

## Ability

Imagine that you are a red-teamer on an operation that requires delivering Malicious code into the victim‚Äôs computer Gaining access remotely, Stealing Credentials, or even opening a Fake Update Screen. This operation usually takes some time to approach, but clocks are ticking. 
In Real Life Red-Teaming Engagement, You are not allowed to use others' computers for a long time. 

Hence, BadUSBs take a place. Shortening the time for you. Using one of these USBs Could Deliver Your Malicious Code in 3 SECONDS. AWESOME RIGHT!

## BadUSB DIY

BadUSBs can be programmed on an ATmega32U4 Microcontrollers with [Keyboard and Mouse](https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/usb/KeyboardAndMouseControl) Support found in Multiple Arduino Boards such as Pro Micro, Leonardo, and Due.

Above, We Previewed Many Commercial Tools That Can Be Purchased Online to Perform HID Attacks, But Most of These Products are Above 30$. 
Moving Forward, You Will be able to Make Your Own BadUSB Starting From 1$ With the Digispark board That Can Be Found in Local Markets.

### BadUSB and Attiny85

In This Section, We Will Use Digispark Board and Arduino IDE to make a pretty cheap, and effective BadUSB. 

![BadUSB%202.png](/images/BadUSB%202.png)

ATmega32U4 Microcontroller Attiny85 Board with Mouse and Keyboard Support. PERFECT! 

- Costs Less than 1$
- Micro Pocket-Size
- Can Perform HID Attacks
- Easy To use and Program using Arduino IDE

### Requirement and Installation

- Download the appropriate Arduino package at the Arduino.cc [website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)

You will need to download and install the drivers manually. 

- Download, unzip and run ‚ÄúInstall Drivers‚Äù for 32-bit systems or ‚ÄúDPInst64‚Äù for 64-bit systems. You Can Download The Driver Files from [HERE](https://github.com/digistump/DigistumpArduino/releases/download/1.6.7/Digistump.Drivers.zip).
- Install or Unzip the Arduino application.
- Run the Arduino application.
- In the Arduino application go to the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu and select ‚ÄúPreferences‚Äù
****

- In the ‚ÄúAdditional Boards Manager URLs‚Äù box, Enter: `[http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json](http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json)` 
then, click OK.

![BadUSB.jpeg](/images/BadUSB.jpeg)

- Go to the ‚ÄúTools‚Äù menu, and then the ‚ÄúBoard‚Äù sub-menu
- Select ‚ÄúBoards Manager‚Äù and then from the Type drop-down select ‚ÄúContributed‚Äù
- Select the ‚ÄúDigistump AVR Boards‚Äù package and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button.
- You'll see the download progress on the bottom bar of the ‚ÄúBoards Manager‚Äù window, when complete it will show ‚ÄúInstalled‚Äù next to that item on the list.
- When complete the install with pop up a Driver Install Wizard window, click ‚ÄúNext‚Äù on this Window to install the drivers for Digistump Boards
- With the install complete, close the ‚ÄúBoards Manager‚Äù window and select the Digispark from the Tools‚ÜíBoards menu. ‚ÄúDigispark (Default - 16.5mhz)‚Äù is the board that should be selected. As shown below.

## Prevention

To protect your organization from such an attack as the BadUSB, You will have to use: 

- Port Blockers
- Restricting access to CMD with admin privileges
- SandUSBs
- GoodUSB
