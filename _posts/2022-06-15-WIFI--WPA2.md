# Introduction

WiFi is probably the most common wireless protocol used by billions of users and IoT devices. But, Unfortunately, WiFi has had some Weaknesses over the years, and so the relative huge adoption of this protocol makes the Attack Surface Wider and Wider. 

## IEEE and Wifi Alliance

Protocols like Bluetooth have one guiding body, Wi-Fi on the other side has two: The Wi-Fi alliance and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or IEEE.

The IEEE deals with only Layer 1 and 2 in Wi-FI technology - How signals are placed in the air, Modulation/Demodulation, etc. 

On the other hand: 

The Wi-Fi Alliance develops and supports standards higher up in the stack, such as those associated with wireless encryption. 
WPA, WPA2, and WPA3 are products of the Wi-Fi Alliance.

## WPA2

In order to encrypt the traffic between the Station (Client) and the Access Point, Some keys has to be exchanged between the two. This process of key exchange called 4-Way-Handshaking 

## 4-Way-Handshake

4-Way Handshake is the process of exchanging 4 messages between an access-point and client device to generate some encryption keys which can be used to encrypt actual data sent over wireless network.
Imagine an access point is configured with WPA2/PSK and device is trying to connect to it. 
In our example its SSID PRINTERS with password printer123.

This is where 4-way handshake happens, instead of sending the password directly to the Access Points there are EAPOL (Extensible authentication protocol over LAN) messages exchange happens.

### How Key Generation Works

- The first level key is generated is MSK during the process of 802.1X/EAP or PSK authentication.
- The second level key is generated from MSK (Master Session Key) is PMK (Pairwise Master Key) and GMK (Group Master Key).
- PMK is used to generate PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) and GMK (Group Master Key) is used to create GTK (Group Temporal Key).
- Third level keys are the actual keys used for data encryption.

    ## EAPOL Message 1 of 4
    
    Access Point Sends EAPOL Message with **ANonce** (Random Number) to the Device to Generate PTK. 
    
    ```scheme
    **PTK = PRF (PMK + Anonce + SNonce + Mac (AA)+ Mac (SA))**
    ```
    
    In this Message Access Point Sending **ANonce** to the client device.

## EAPOL Message 2 of 4

Once the device has created its PTK it sends out SNonce which is needed by the Access Point to generate PTK (Pairwise Transient Key) as well. 

The device sends EAPOL to AP Message 2 with MIC (Message Integrity Check) to make sure when the access point can verify whether this message corrupted or modified. 

Once SNonce Received by the AP it Can Generate PTK as well for Unicast Traffic Encryption.

**In Other Words:** 

This is the Second Message Going from the Client Device to AP with SNonce and MIC field set to 1.

## EAPOL Message 3 of 4

EAPOL message 3 is sent from AP to client device containing GTK (Group Temporal Key). 
AP creates GTK without the involvement of the client from GMK (Group Master Keys).

And The Keys have been installed. 

## EAPOL Message 4 of 4

Fourth and last EPOL message will be sent from the client to AP just to confirm that Keys have been installed.

## MAC Layer

The The Media Access Control (MAC) layer in WiFi (802.11) Frames contains a wealth of information; 

- Fragmentation Support
- Separation of Networks in the Same Frequency Ranges
- Encryption “Privacy”
- Supported Data Rates

### Basic MAC Terms

Certain terms when dealing with the MAC layer may be unfamiliar to you. 
Let’s Quick Review some of The MAC Terms.

IBSS (ad-hoc) vs. Infrastructure Networks: 

STA: Stands for Station “Client”

SSID: Stands for Service Set Identifier, or the “name” of a network.

BSSID: Stands for Basic Service Set Identification. The BSSID is 48-bit MAC address.

ESSID: Stands for Extended Service Set Identifier. The ESSID is The MAC Address of Client on a network. 

EAP: Stands for Extensible Authentication Protocol, EAP allows for the authentication on the enterprise mode 802.11x wireless network with additional Security Features.

## IEEE802.11 Frame Header

The 802.11 Frame Header was Defined and Modified from 1999 forward. There are Three Different types of 802.11 Frame Header: 

**Management Frames:** Used for Requesting Association/Authentication, De-Associate/De-Authenticate, Probing for Network, and Advertising Becons. 

**Data Frames:** Used for The Transmission of Traffic (Data) across the network. 

**Control Frames:** Helps with the delivery of the other two frame types, and include functions for medium management (RTS/CTS), and ACK. 

![WPA2](/images/WPA2%207.png)

- **Frame Control(FC) –** It is 2 bytes long field which defines type of frame and some control information. 11 other fields present in FC:
    
    
    | Name | Number of Bits | Usage  |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Version | 2-bits | indicates the current protocol version which is fixed to be 0 for now. |
    | Type | 2-bits | determines the function of frame i.e management(00), control(01) or data(10). (11) is reserved. |
    | Subtype | 4-bits | indicates sub-type of the frame i.e 0000 for association request, 1000 for beacon. |
    | To DS | 1-bit | indicates that destination frame is for DS (distribution system) |
    | From DS | 1-bit | When set indicates frame coming from DS |
    | More Fragments | 1-bit | When set to 1 means frame is followed by other fragments. |
    | Retry  | 1-bit | Sets to 1 when the current frame is retransmission of an earlier frame. |
    | Power Mgmt. | 1-bit | When Set to 1, the field indicates that the station goes into power-save mode. If the field is set to 0, the station stays active. |
    | More Data | 1-bit | indicate receiver that a sender has more data to send than the current frame |
    | WEP | 1-bit  | indicates that the standard security mechanism of 802.11 is applied |
    | Order | 1-bit | when set to 1, the received frames must be processed in strict order. |
- **Duration:** It is 4 bytes long field which contains the value indicating the period of time in which the medium is occupied.
- **Address 1 to 4:** These are 6 bytes long fields which contain standard IEEE 802 MAC addresses (48 bit each). 
The meaning of each address depends on the DS bits in the frame control field.
- **Sequence Control:** It is 16 bits long field which consists of 2 sub-fields, i.e., Sequence number (12 bits) and Fragment number (4 bits). Since acknowledgement mechanism frames may be duplicated hence, a sequence number is used to filter duplicate frames.
- **Data:** It is a variable length field which contain information specific to individual frames which is transferred transparently from a sender to the receiver(s).
- **CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check:** It is 4 bytes long field which contains a 32 bit CRC error detection sequence to ensure error free frame.

## Weaknesses

### Deauthentication Attack (Denial of Service):

Management Frames include (Association, Authentication, De-authentication, Beacon, Probe)
Management Frames Sent as Plain-Text Over the Area. Consequently, An Attacker can manipulate this weakness by replaying a deauthentication frame to the AP using MAC Address of the Victim. 

![WPA2](/images/WPA2%208.png)

### Handshake Capture:

As a Result of sending Management Frames as **Association** and **Authentication** as plain text. 
Attacker can manipulate this weakness by monitoring the network traffic extracting the BSSID, Channel, ESSID, etc. With the right tool and the right arguments you will be able to perform
deauthentication attack, forcing a client of a network to reconnect. 
Capturing **EAPOL Messages** along with the Keys, that contains the Passphrase to the network as .pcap file ready to be brute-forced. 

![WPA2](/images/WPA2%209.png)

### Evil Twin

Attackers Can initiate a new network with the same **SSID** name and Network Settings, Then, Perform **Denial of Service** attack on the **original** network. 
Making all the clients that tries to reconnect. Connects to **your** network.

Also, The Attack can be escalated, Performing Cache or DNS Poisoning to steal Credentials and sensitive data.

![WPA2](/images/WPA2%2010.png)

### KRACK

Key Reinstallation Attack, Can be Summarized as the Following: 
When a client joins a network, the 4-way handshake negotiates a fresh encryption key. 
and that key installs after receiving message 3 of 4 EAPOL. 
Once the key installed, it will be used to encrypt normal data frames using an encryption protocol. However, because EAPOL Messages may be lost or dropped, 
the Access Point (AP) will retransmit **Message 3** if it did not receive an appropriate response as acknowledgment. 

![WPA2](/images/WPA2%2011.png)

Each time the client receives this message, it will reinstall the same encryption key, and thereby reset the incremental transmit packet number (Nonce) and receive replay counter used by the encryption protocol. 

Attackers can force these Nonce resets by collecting and replaying retransmissions of message 3 of the 4-way handshake. 
By forcing nonce reuse in this manner, the encryption protocol can be attacked, packets can be replayed, decrypted, and/or forged.

### KR00K

KR00K Vulnerability Follows KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attacks) as the two are related but also fundamentally different.

**Kr00k** Exploits a vulnerability versions of **wpa_supplicant 2.4 and 2.5**, install an **all-zero encryption key (TK)** when receiving a retransmitted **Message 3**. 
This vulnerability appears to be caused by a remark in the 802.11 standard that indirectly suggests to clear the TK from memory once it has been installed. 
WLAN chips manufactured by **Broadcom** and **Cypress**, **Android below v6.0** are the most **vulnerable.** Also**,** Attackers can decrypt all network traffic and break into the WPA2 Security, but, most of websites uses **HTTPS/HSTS** which forces you to connect of port **443 HTTPS**. Kr00k Rated **LOW** on severity tests.

## Mitigations

- Use MFP (Management Frame Protection) // IEEE 802.1w
- Whitelisting
- Update to WPA3
- Testing your Network for KRACK/KR00K. 
If it’s valid, Replacing the Access Point would be the solution
- Make Strong, and Unique Password For Your Network
